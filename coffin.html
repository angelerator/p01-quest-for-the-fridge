        You nervously creep over to the coffin. With every step, the floor creaks. That humming from before begins to get ever so slightly louder as you approach the coffin. Your heart beats hard in your chest, and
        it is increasingly difficult to breath, as if a thick air is emnating from the coffin. You feel as if you could crack at any moment, this sense of dread overcoming all of your senses as you approach this
        dark mass. The cold air seems to be digging into your psyche. <i>What the hell were you doing?</i> You pause for a second, calming yourself and taking short, deep breaths. A few more steps and you finally
        reach the coffin. It is completely black, and it feels as if you are staring into a void... The deep humming doesn't seem to be coming from inside the coffin, but you can't be sure. All you can hear
        is your heartbeat. What will you do now?
