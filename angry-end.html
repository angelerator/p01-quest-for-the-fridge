        Feeling helpless and distraught, you begin to lash out in anger. You turn around and throw the hammer as hard as you can at the poster on the wall and begin to kick and punch things while
        angrily cursing at the house. <i>"Why am I even here!? Why can't I just get a nice breakfast in this godforsaken mansion!?"</i> You effectively tear down the shelves and knock over the containers and
        utensils all around the room until you finally slump to the floor, exhausted from your temper tantrum. After taking a minute to catch your breath after such a marvelous fit, your eyes wander to
        the poster on the wall. Now, there is a hole through it. You also notice... ketchup. Yes, ketchup is on the poster. No, it's in the poster..... No! it's <i>through</i> the poster! You immediately
        stand up and go over to the hole and peer through it. It appears that the poster was covering some glass pane, with food on the other side. Well, just some condiments... but, pulling back the poster
        reveals that the compartment is actually the inside of a normal fridge, and you are just on the backside of it. You push your way through the fragile shelves and break your way through to your kitchen.
        You look down on the floor and see a piece of tinfoil with a hammer lodged in it, along with rice, beans, and pieces of chicken scattered across the floor. You fall to your knees, happy to finally make it
        to your fridge, and also defeated because you ruined the leftover burrito you were looking forward to eating.
