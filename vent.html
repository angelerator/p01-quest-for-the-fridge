        You decide to pry open the vent cover next to the bed and crawl into the vents. As you continue crawling, the vents begin to get smaller and smaller.
        It is very tough with such little room, and it's difficult to continue wiggling yourself through such a tight space. These vents are much longer than you initially believed,
        and it feels as if it's a neverending tunnel. There are many turns that you make, but no splits in the vent. You can barely see, you are sweating profusely, and you can barely
        keep going, but you finally come to a split in the vents. To the left you can feel a nice, cool breeze while to the right you feel a bit of warmth. Which way should you go?
