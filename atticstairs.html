        Yeah, the coffin ain't going anywhere, and you've a mind to leave it that way. You nonchalantly go over to the stairs, happy that you won't have to deal with this creepy attic any more than you have to.
        But as you take your first step down the stairs, you stop. Looking down the stairs you cannot see past the doorway due to how dark it is. The door is open though, at least. You just start to feel
        a bit scared and nervous about this staircase. You expected this to just lead out to the main part of the house but it doesn't seem like it... You cautiously move down to the doorway. Yup, total blackness
        on the other side. There's also a cool breeze for some reason. You bob your head around and squint to try to make anything out in the darkness. You can kind of make out that you are in a hallway, but
        nothing really concrete. You also see a very small movement at the end of the hallway...
