        You click your tongue in annoyance and toss the hammer over your shoulder. <i>"Worthless... is there really no way to get out of here? That can't be right..."</i> As you begin to think of other
        solutions to your predicament, you hear glass shatter behind you. You quickly turn around in confusion and see that the poster of the knight now has a large tear in it, and that it was actually
        covering a glass pane. You walk over to the hole an peer into it. It appears that the poster was covering the backside of a fridge for some reason. It appears to be the fridge in your kitchen!
        You see the leftover burrito you left last night and happily grab it and chow down. Finally! Some food! You can focus on getting out later.
      </p>
      <div style="float:right">
        <h1 class="congrats"><i>Congratulations! You won a cold, half-eaten burrito.</i></h1>
