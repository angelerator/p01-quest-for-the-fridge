        <i>The Quest for the Fridge</i>
      </h>
      <p>
        You wake up in a comfortable bed. You open your eyes slowly as bright sunlight is shining through a window next to the bed, and you sit up to look around. You feel a bit uneasy,
        since you've only just moved into the house your cousin left you after his death a month ago and the room is very unfamiliar. Well, so is the entire house. Your uneasiness turns to hunger
        as you realize you forgot to eat last night due to the long drive to the house yesterday. You decide to get out of bed and get something to eat from the fridge. The fridge. Where was the
        kitchen again? You go to open the door to get out of the room but it seems to be stuck and won't open. Great. It's a large, ornate door so you can't seem to force it open. You look around
        to see if there's another way out of the room. There is the large window next to the bed you could climb out of, but this is the third floor... On the ceiling there
        is what seems to be a string to pull down an opening to the attic. There is also a large vent close to the floor, big enough for you to fit, right next to the bed that you might be able to crawl
        through. What will you do?
