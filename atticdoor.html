      </h>

        You tug on the string connected to the ceiling and a ladder folds out before you. You are immediately taken by a chilling wind and start to shiver. You can hear a distant and faint, deep hum
        coming from the dark attic. You climb the ladder into the darkness. The space is tall enough to stand up, and it takes a moment for your eyes to adjust. It's unnaturally chilly up here and you
        begin to shiver. You can make out a couple boxes and a doorway a couple feet ahead of you. You stop at the doorway and look around to see that there is a... coffin propped up against the wall
        on your left. On the right you see stairs leading down into the house. You are relieved to see that there is a simple way back down... but, what is this coffin doing up here? The room is empty
        aside from this coffin. What will you do?
