        Oh god, yeah screw that. You try to ignore whatever that movement was and instead start feeling around for a light switch or a door knob. You hear a door close at the end of the hallway. While nearly
        having a heart attack, you flip a switch on the wall and the hallway lights up. This too gives you a heart attack and you fall to the floor in fright. <i>"Oh god, that was the breeze right? I hope it was
        because I ain't having none of that"</i> you think to yourself as you nearly soil yourself. You stand back up and look around. It's just a normal... creepy hallway. Nothing to be scared about.
        There's nothing else to do here except check what's behind the doors...
